    "This project explores the seaborn Titanic dataset.  With the goal of being able to predict a continuous target with regression, linear regression as well as some alternative models will all be created and evaluated in terms of predicting fare, the price of the journey.  The data will be explored and prepped before the models are created.  There will be a summary at the end to discuss the findings."

    "2) Propose a possible explanation:  **Family size may relate to fare because larger families probably traveled in cheaper classes.  Age might add that older adults could afford higher classes, so for instance grandparents may have stayed in a higher class than the rest or something along those lines.  So there was a slight increase in performance.**\n",
