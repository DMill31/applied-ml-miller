    "This project explores the seaborn Titanic dataset.  With the goal of being able to predict a continuous target with regression, linear regression as well as some alternative models will all be created and evaluated in terms of predicting fare, the price of the journey.  The data will be explored and prepped before the models are created.  There will be a summary at the end to discuss the findings."

    "**Compare the train vs test results**\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Did Case 1 overfit or underfit? Explain: **Underfit.  The R2 value is incredibly low in both training and testing, it explains practically none of the variance.**\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Did Case 2 overfit or underfit? Explain: **Underfit.  Similar to Case 1, the R2 values in both datasets are too low.**\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Did Case 3 overfit or underfit? Explain: **Underfit.  While better than the previous cases, again the R2 values are too low.**\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Did Case 4 overfit or underfit? Explain: **Neither.  Both R2 values are almost identical and relatively high.  I'd say it's a good model, no overfitting and no underfitting.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Adding Age**\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Did adding age improve the model? **Yes, Case 3 performed slightly better than Case 2.**\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Propose a possible explanation:  **Family size may relate to fare because larger families probably traveled in cheaper classes.  Age might add that older adults could afford higher classes, so for instance grandparents may have stayed in a higher class than the rest or something along those lines.  So there was a slight increase in performance.**\n",

    "**Worst**\n",

    "1) Which case performed the worst: **Case 1**\n",
    "\n",
    "2) How do you know? **It had the lowest R2 score and the highest RMSE and MAE scores.**\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Do you think adding more training data would improve it?  **No, I believe that the feature age doesn't explain basically any of the variation in fare.**\n",

    "**Best**\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Which case performed the best: **Case 4**\n",
    "\n",
    "2) How do you know? **It had the highest R2 score and the lowest RMSE and MAE scores.**\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Do you think adding more training data would improve it? **No, the model only uses two predictors that explain roughly a third of fare's variation.  I believe the rest of the variation lies in other predictors.**"
